      "review": "Another great game in this epic action RPG series! Tons of fun and hours of enjoyment. Well worth your time and dime!\n\nMany changes and improvements from MH World but also a few odd changes like removing scouting and having it automated by a new pet Cohoot. This change didn't really bother me but there are some small differences like this you might not enjoy. It's a minor graphical downgrade from World but the trade off is better performance and the Japanese inspired theme is a nice touch so in the end it still looks nice.\n\nIf you've never enjoyed this series before there's a bunch of fun weapon types to check out and plenty of gear to craft. Collect and train Palico and Palamute pets to back you up, you can bring two pets in solo missions and one pet to online missions. Tons of gear and a variety of skills for them as well.\n\nA lot of classic monsters return while adding a few new ones that fit the game's theme very nicely. As usual you will slaughter many of them while running quests and challenges to keep you busy.",

      "review": "I've had atleast 5000 hours in the monster hunter series and let me say rise/sunbreak are not bad games but in comparison to world/IB, rise is lackluster. in 181 hours I've finished all content this game has to offer plus Sunbreak end game\n\npros:\n- Combat is fucking fun with wirebugs and switch skills \n- new monsters are dope \n- music is chef's kiss\n- npc quests are a cool new edition which i hope to see in the future\n\nCons: oh this is going to be a very very long list\n- it seems all monsters are hyper aggressive and buffed up with steroids as if you are fighting mini versions of Fatalis with no downtime between attacks \n- rampage quests are the worst content to ever exist in monster hunter since 3U\n- anomaly quests are the worst end game content i have yet to witness. you are basically fighting the same monsters again but the catch is they have 4 times the hp and double the damage with some small monsters gaining insane speed on attacks and moves \n- hitboxes are the jankiest shit I've experienced. this is the most MH that made me go WTF towards so many monster attacks that look grounded but for some reason they hit me when I'm 10 meters in the air \n- online matchmaking is borderline garbage and not functioning (in rise you choose and quest and queues up to search for people who are playing this quest, note that in certain cases like Valstrax quest they have 6 different quests based on the locale and each queue takes a minute. so imagine 6 minutes of waiting because no one who's fighting Valstrax has the SoS thing turned on. unlike world where you get to see a list of all quests and pick whichever suits you fancy)\n- we went down from a whopping 16 players lobby to 4 players, if one afks you have to remove them \n- while some of the aesthetics are nice but the overall graphical fidelity is lackluster  \n- narwa, ibushi and the all mother \n- why is ingot greaves some of the BiS for alot of builds?\n- monsters only have 1 set instead of Alpha and Beta which limits build variety alot and adds alot of wasted skills towards your build\n- Talismans grind for MR is on par and in my opinion even worse than deco farming in iceborne. this shit is horrible and needs to be fixed \n- developers balanced a lot of monsters around Spirit Birds (orange, yellow, green and red birds) so if you are not taking a 2 minutes route to buff up your stats before fighting the harder end game content a simple attack that doesn't even flinch will take 40% of your health if not more. this makes all end game hunts have a preparation time of 2 minutes just to collect the buffs so you don't get instantly killed during a hunt. It reminds me a lot of Dark Souls 2 Adaptability stat \n\nVerdict:\nMonster Hunter Rise/SB is a good Monster Hunter regardless of the many issues. However, when compared to the previous title IB it cannot hold a candle to the amount of content IB offered to us. I’ll still play rise but those are my two cents",

All of the new switch skills and the new switch skill swap system add new levels of depth.  Especially when you factor in all of the new armor skills that play with the skill swap system.  The new maps are a blast to play on and the new endemic life adds more variance to the hunts.  Follower quests are a fun twist, and the monsters actually put up a fight now.  There are a couple things I would like to see added to the game including layered armors, rainbow pigment, and more in-depth room customization.  However I am hopeful that at least the first 2 will be added in future updates.  I still feel confident recommending this game on what is here already though.",

      "review": "[h1] Introduction [/h1]\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the [i] Monster Hunter [/i] series, it gives exactly what the title promises. You hunt monsters in their, mostly, natural habitat. And it is exactly this habitat, that makes [i] Monster Hunter [/i] special, it doesn't just throw some random enemies in a fantasy world, it tries to build an ecosystem and plays with the limits of their world to make that ecosystem as creative and interesting as possible. This aspect, as a enthusiast for speculative evolution, gripped my attention as well as the intricate progression system, as I'm a sucker for games in which you can truly feel the advancement in both your equipment but most importantly your skill.\n\nI started with the 3rd Gen in 2013 and have played every major installment since with [i] Monster Hunter: World [/i] being my favourite by far. I didn't go into this game with especially high expectations, as it still is a Switch port and the team behind the game leans more into the eccentric side of [i] Monster Hunter. [/i]\n\n[h1] Combat and Movement [/h1]\n\n[i] Monster Hunter: Rise [/i], as pretty much all [i] Monster Hunter [/i] games, tries to introduce a new gimmick, this time being the Wire Bug. The Wire Bug enables an unprecedented freedom of movement, wherein the map is now a huge field instead of walled of sections. You can climb anywhere, making exploration that much more exciting.\n\nUnfortunately, they had to also include this new feature into the combat. This on itself wouldn't be that tragic, even if you're not a fan of it, but the Wire Bug completely changes the focus and momentum of the battle. Instead of staying on the ground after being thrown away, you can now save your fall by just zipping away, essentially negating the punishing effect of being hit, in fact many attacks of returning monsters don't stagger you as hard as in previous games. This makes careful observation and timed dodging much less important, taking away much satisfaction.\n\nBut the Wire Bug isn't just a new option in battle, many attacks were changed to now be used with it. I can't say if this is only caused by me preferring to use Mouse and Keyboard over Controller, but the control scheme changed completely from World because of this, even for actions that don't require the Wire Bug, like collecting items.\n\nRelearning the controls after 600 hours of getting used to them in [i] World [/i] was difficult to say the least.\n\n[h1] Environment [/h1]\n\nThis is in my opinion the biggest flaw of [i] Rise. [/i] Coming from [i] World, [/i] I wasn't expecting next gen graphics but it's not the graphics that are at fault here, it's the aesthetic. I started [i] Monster Hunter Rise [/i] and [i] Monster Hunter Freedom Unite [/i] on the same day and at times I thought the latter looked much better. [i] MHFU [/i] came out on the PSP for reference.\n\nEverything feels washed out with an unnatural saturation being added later. There are two returning maps and they both somehow look uglier than they did 10 years ago. The rocks have this weird shader which makes them look like plastic and for somewhat reason most maps are covered with water which would be fine for 3rd Gen, because of the swimming mechanic, but here it's just huge lakes which are equal depth throughout, giving them an artificial flair. For the non-water map 'Sandy Plains' they decided to give the map two layers, a desert on top with a cave underneath, which would be a cool concept if it didn't make the map look like swiss cheese, I didn't even recognize the map at first. \n\nTo top it all off, the game has the monster's habitats all over the place, like temperate and tropical monsters being found in the Frost Islands. It makes me feel like the creators didn't care as much for the environment and wanted to focus on making the combat and movement flashier. I've heard people say [i] Monster Hunter Rise [/i] is closer to the core of [i] Monster Hunter [/i] than [i] Monster Hunter: World [/i] and unless you mean [i] Generations [/i] or [i] Frontier [/i] by that, I couldn't disagree more\n\n[h1] The Monsters [/h1]\n\nOh boy, let me just say, that I love the concept of making Yokai into actual animals but it could have been executed so much better. I like most early game monsters but others like Magnamalo or the final boss have too many body parts that are just there to 'look cool' instead of serving an actual purpose. They also decided to redesign the Zinogre from [i] Monster Hunter: World [/i] to look more cartoony like in the old games.\n\nInstead of Endemic Life like in World we now have 'Hunting Helpers' which all give you some sort of buff. I just wanna see some animals that make sense in their environment not some bunny that appears on every map and buffs my potions for someone reason. Don't even get me started on the Spiribirds, I don't want to scour the entire map each quest to get the max amount of health and stamina.\n\nMagnamalo's hellfire is never explained either, which I found to be very unusual, as unexplained phenomena are usually reserved for Elder Dragons. To add to that, they decided to include cross-species telepathy which gave me a pause when I first saw it.\n\nTo give the game credit though, the soundtrack of the monsters and the environment is really well done. I find myself listening to the tune of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q71EdQ3XT4Q&t] Magnamalo [/url] or the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwOvt0ql-bQ] Rampage [/url] fairly regularly.\n\n[h1] Conclusion  [/h1]\n\n[i] Monster Hunter Rise [/i] is a mixed bag for me, I would probably give it a 'meh' if I could. It improves on so many things from previous titles but at the same time fails at many others. \n\n[i] Monster Hunter Rise [/i] is for [i] Monster Hunter [/i] fans that focus more on combat than world-building. It certainly appeals to the huge part of the fandom being interested in Anime. Unfortunately I can't count myself among them and I hope for [i] Monster Hunter 6 [/i] to be more grounded, more in par with [i] Monster Hunter Freedom Unite [/i] or [i] Tri. [/i]\n\nUntil then I'm gonna try [i] Sunbreak [/i] when it goes on sale (hopefully soon), maybe there still is a reedeming quality in [i] Rise [/i] that I missed.",
